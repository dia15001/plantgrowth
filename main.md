- [ ] Experimenting
- [ ] Reporting

We have everything planned and we are getting ready for the experiment.

##
## Plant Information

The plant we will be using for the experiment is [Grass.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae)

We choose Grass because:
##
- It is easy to take care of
- It grows fast
- It does not grow too tall
##
## Related Research

We did research about our experiment. We looked at [Grow Lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light) and how it affects the growth of plants.
